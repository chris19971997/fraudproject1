NY Property Data

This is the project 1 of the Fraud Analytics course in Spring 2019 at University of Southern California, 
instructed by Dr. Stephen Coggeshall.

This project is about New York City Property Data Analysis and Fraud Detection.

In this project, I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoder to detect anomarlies in NY Property data.

Data can be retrieved from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Property-Valuation-and-Assessment-Data/rgy2-tti8
